		#CAE_CommAntenna_title = C2 Communotron EXP-VR-2T
		#CAE_CommAntenna_desc = This effective and compact folding antenna is highly recommended for your research missions.
		#CAE_CommAntenna_tags = aerial antenna deploy direct extend fold radio signal transmi

		#CAE_DeployableAntenna_title = C2+ High Gain Antenna HG-32
		#CAE_DeployableAntenna_desc = Our researchers started working on the Kerbin System Network Project, but encountered a problem: it is needed too many HG-5 antennas on each vessel, but discovering Giga-powered antennas is not expected any time soon. So, a longer-but-still-short-range communications antenna was born. It won't reach much beyond Kerbin's SOI, but it will offer higher-quality communications from Kerbin's moons. Also you can create Kerbin System Network with pair of those on each vessel. It's not perfect, but working.

		#CAE_CommDish1_title = C3+ Relay Antenna RA-7
		#CAE_CommDish1_desc = Locals complained about their missing garbage lids, so our engineers quickly made an alternative, accidentally, an antenna. It dominates RA-2 and it's without the ugly handle.

		#CAE_CommDish2_title = C4+ Relay Antenna RA-25
		#CAE_CommDish2_desc = Replacing the RA-15, this antenna will carry your signal beyond Duna, looking fancier than ever.

		#CAE_CommDish3_title = C5+ Communotron "Tigger"
		#CAE_CommDish3_desc = The wonderful thing about tiggers <br>Is tiggers are wonderful things!<br>-- Tigger Kerman. <br><br>A massive interplanetary extandable direct antenna. Wherever you are in the Kerbol system, you'll be able to stay in contact with this. Pair of tiggers can bounce together on 1000G rating.

		#CAE_CommDish4_title = C5+ RelayTech One
		#CAE_CommDish4_desc = A massive interplanetary relay antenna can reach almost anything in the solar system. Simular to its sibling "Tigger" it is combinable at a level unseen, since the start of Kerbal Space Program.
